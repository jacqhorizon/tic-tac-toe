## Description

My goal for the summer was to complete projects that would help me learn new skills and explore career paths. In collaboration with my mentor, I decided my first project would be to build a Tic Tac Toe AI bot. My goal was to practice completing a MVP and learn about what approaches help avoid overscoping a project. In addition to learning how to a simple AI bot.

## Approach

I approached the planning for this project as if I was writing an "assignment" for myself. I started by designing the project with sketches and a list of features. I also identified checkpoints to keep myself on track to completing the project in 3 weeks.

One challenge I encountered was my minimax algorithm was not working as expected. As my second checkpoint approached, I reached out to some friends for fresh eyes and worked on other areas of the project. I also refered to other tutorials to see what they did differently. 

## Takeaways

- I learned how to apply recursive algorithms to practical uses
- Better understanding of how to focus on the minimum viable features in order to complete a project quickly
- I learned the benefits of approaching project planning from a "teacher's" perspective
- Next time, I would write messier code from the start and clean it up later
